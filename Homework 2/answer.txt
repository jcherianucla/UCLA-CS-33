Problem 3.60
A.) %rdi holds x initially but is then moved to %r8;
n is initially in %esi but is then moved to %ecx;
result is stored in %rax and the mask is stored in %rdx.

B.)Result is initially set to 0, while Mask is set to 1.

C.)mask != 0; mask = mask << (n&0xFF)

D.)Mask is left shifted by the lower 8 bits of n i.e. mask = mask << (n&0xFF)

E.) result |= (x&mask);
